<p>My life lived as a nomad.</p>
<h2 id="why-remote">Why Remote?</h2>
<p>Freedom of location opens up new lifestyles that are not possible when we are tied down. An office job keeps us commuting (stuck in traffic for a big piece of the day), keeps us from straying too far from the house (commute in the morning or at weekend end), and leaves little room for exploring this god given earth. Forget saving up your PTO for a measly 2 weeks traveling (not to mention the time lost in transit with flying, buses, ride shares, etc.), prepare for life on the road, you will thank yourself for the memories made later.</p>
